Derivation of the 3.7 micron reflectance
----------------------------------------

The monochromatic reflectivity (or reflectance) :math:`\rho_{\lambda}` is the
ratio of the reflected (backscattered) radiance to the incident radiance. In
the case of solar reflection one can write:

.. math::

    \rho_{\lambda} = \frac{L_{\lambda}}{\mu_0 L_{\lambda 0}}

where :math:`L_{\lambda}` is the measured radiance, :math:`L_{\lambda 0}` is
the incoming solar radiance, and :math:`\mu_0` is the cosine of the solar
zenith angle :math:`\theta_0`.
