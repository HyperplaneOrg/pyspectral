Given a passive sensor on a meteorological satellite the purpose of pyspectral
is to provide you with the relative spectral response (rsr) function(s) and
offer you with some basic operations like convolution with the solar spectrum
to derive the In-band solar flux for instance. The focus is first of all
imaging sensors like AVHRR, VIIRS, MODIS, and SEVIRI. But if needed other
sensors can be added.
